The file extensions `.crt`, `.pem`, and `.p12` are commonly used in different contexts for storing certificates and keys. Here's a brief explanation of when to use each file format:

1. `.crt` (or `.cer`): This file format is often used for X.509 public key certificates. It typically contains only the public key and does not include the private key. You would typically use a `.crt` file for distributing or sharing public certificates, such as when configuring SSL/TLS for a web server.

2. `.pem` (or Privacy-Enhanced Mail): The `.pem` format is a flexible format that can be used to store different types of cryptographic data, including certificates, private keys, and certificate chains. The content within a `.pem` file is typically Base64-encoded and enclosed between `-----BEGIN ...-----` and `-----END ...-----` markers. A `.pem` file can contain a single certificate, a private key, or both. It is a common format for storing certificates and keys, and can be used in various scenarios, such as configuring SSL/TLS for a web server or working with cryptographic tools.

3. `.p12` (or `.pfx`): The `.p12` format, also known as PKCS#12, is an archive format that can store both the private key and the corresponding certificate in a single file. It is commonly used for exporting and importing certificate and key pairs, especially in the context of Java-based systems. The file is password-protected and can include the certificate chain. You would typically use a `.p12` file when you need to package the private key and certificate together, such as when importing a certificate into a Java keystore.

It's worth noting that these file formats are not mutually exclusive, and the choice of format depends on the specific requirements and tools you are using. Additionally, some tools and systems may support multiple file formats, allowing you to convert between them as needed.
